##Examples

### Running the examples

Open a terminal. In order to run, for example, example 1:

```bash
cd myproject/node_modules/eventemitter4
node doc/examples/1-on.js
```

Classes that inherit from event emitters are notoriously difficult to debug. Do not hesitate to use the `EventEmitter.toString()` function to dump a copy of the internal state of the emitter. This will usually tell you what is going on, and where the bug is.

### Example 1

For: _EventEmitter4.on(event,listener)_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/1-on.js"
```

**Output**

        clean up the table, John.

Any function registered `on()` an event will be triggered when the emitter invokes the `emit()` function with that particular event.

### Example 2

**Program**

For: _EventEmitter4.once(event,listener)_

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/2-once.js"
```
**Output**

        clean up the table, John.

After triggering a listener registered with `once()`, it will fire one time for the event. After that it will not trigger any longer.

### Example 3

For: _EventEmitter4.onAny(listener)_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/3-onAny.js"
```

**Output**

        clean up the table, John.
        yes, mum
        go, take a shower, John.
        yes, mum
        go, take a shower, Ann.

On a particular event, _Mum_ will issue an instruction for _John_, while _John_ is registered to listen to any message. So, he hears everything. However, because of the _if_-clause, he only responds to events for which the argument _who_ is _John_. Note that listeners are invoked in the order in which they were registered. Listeners registered with `onAny()` are triggered after all listeners registered with `on()`.

### Example 4

For: _EventEmitter4.removeListener(event,listener)_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/4-removeListener.js"
```

**Output**

        clean up the table, John.
        yes, mum
        clean up the table, John.
        clean up the table, John.


Both _Mum_ and _John_ are registered for the event. The first time _John_ receives the event he responds. After that, the listener is removed, and _John_ stops listening or responding. In this example, the result is in fact the same as if you had used _once()_.

### Example 5

For: _EventEmitter4.removeAllListeners([event])_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/5-removeAllListeners.js"
```

**Output**

        go, take a shower.
        yes, mum (john)
        yes, mum (ann)
        -- Mum, John and Ann now stop listening to the finished-playing-ball event. They still listen to the finished-eating event. --
        clean up the table.
        yes, mum (john)
        yes, mum (ann)

In this example, the _Mum_, _John_ and _Ann_ listeners are registered for both events. Then, we remove all listeners for one event. None of the listeners responds any longer to that event.

### Example 6

**Program**

For: _just one possible way to inherit from EventEmitter4_

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/6-inherited.js"
```

**Output**

        giving order to John
        Yes, mum (John)
        giving order to Ann
        Yes, mum (Ann)

There are many ways to organize inheritance in Javascript. In this particular one, we use _underscore.js_ to extend the prototype of the inheriting class with the functions of the parent class.

### Example 7

**Program**

For: _EventEmitter4.toString()_

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/7-toString.js"
```

**Output**

        {"listeners":{"finished-eating":3,"finished-playing-ball":1},
        "onceListeners":{},
        "listenersToAnyEvent":0}

After registering 4 listeners on 2 different events, you can see in the internal state of the emitter for which events there are listeners registered. This should help with debugging situations in which you expected something else.
