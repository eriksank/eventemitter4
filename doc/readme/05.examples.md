##Examples

### Running the examples

Open a terminal. In order to run for example, example 1:

```bash
cd myproject/node_modules/eventemitter4
node doc/examples/1-on.js
```

### Example 1

For: _EventEmitter4.on(event,listener)_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/1-on.js"
```

**Output**

        clean up the table, John.

Any function registered `on` an event will be triggered when the emitter invokes the `emit` function with that particular event.

### Example 2

**Program**

For: _EventEmitter4.once(event,listener)_

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/2-once.js"
```
**Output**

        clean up the table, John.

After triggering a listener registered with `once`, it will fire one time for the event. After that it won't fire any longer.

### Example 3

For: _EventEmitter4.onAny(listener)_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/3-onAny.js"
```

**Output**

        clean up the table, John.
        yes, mum
        go, take a shower, John.
        yes, mum
        go, take a shower, Ann.

On a particular event, _Mum_ will issue an instruction for _John_, while _John_ is registered to listen to any message. So, he hears everything. However, because of the _if_-clause, he only responds to events for which the argument _who_ is _John_. Note that listeners are invoked in the order in which they were registered. Listeners to any event are triggered after all listeners to a particular event.

### Example 4

For: _EventEmitter4.removeListener(event,listener)_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/4-removeListener.js"
```

**Output**

        clean up the table, John.
        yes, mum
        clean up the table, John.
        clean up the table, John.


Both _Mum_ and _John_ is registered for the event. The first time he receives the event he responds. After that, he stops listening and no longer responds. In this example, the result is in fact the same as using the _once_ function.

### Example 5

For: _EventEmitter4.removeAllListeners([event])_

**Program**

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/5-removeAllListeners.js"
```

**Output**

        go, take a shower.
        yes, mum (john)
        yes, mum (ann)
        -- Both John and Ann stop listening now to the finished-playing-ball event but they still listen to the finished-eating event --
        clean up the table.
        yes, mum (john)
        yes, mum (ann)

### Example 6

**Program**

For: _one possible way to inherit from EventEmitter4_

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/6-inherited.js"
```

**Output**

        giving order to John
        Yes, mum (John)
        giving order to Ann
        Yes, mum (Ann)

There are many ways to organize inheritance in Javascript. In this one, we use _underscorejs_ to extend the prototype of the inheriting class with the functions of the parent class.

### Example 7

**Program**

For: _EventEmitter4.toString()_

```javascript
!INCLUDE "doc/examples/7-toString.js"
```

**Output**

        {"listeners":{"finished-eating":3,"finished-playing-ball":1},
        "onceListeners":{},
        "listenersToAnyEvent":0}

After registering 4 listeners on 2 different events, you can see in the internal state of the emitter for which events there are listeners registered. This should help with debugging situations in which you expected something else.
