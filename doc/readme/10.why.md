##Why EventEmitter4

{{ DRAFT }}

###Let's debunk a widespread fallacy

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding
-information hiding: no need to know 

-only access through API

-- only to some extent true for users of the module
-- not true at all for extenders of the module
-- most users will also be extending eventemitter

- Even for users, it is not entirely true

-- debugging : console.log of the internal state or part of the internal state
-- a problem in your own program can often only be understood by looking at the corrupted state of an external module
-- you must be able to dump the internal state of this module
-- it should have a .toString() method

###underscore.js

- Building EventEmitter --> almost trivial 
- set algebra (functional programming)
==> not relational algebra!
- when debugging your own code, the code of the external module matters

much easier to read
much easier for other people to help fixing bugs and offer pull requests

- performance: relegated to underscore.js
==> now it is their problem

###Why not the standard nodejs EventEmitter
- no onAny

###Why not EventEmitter2
- has onAny
- Too much functionality: on('foo.*')
==> hard to debug

###Why not EventEmitter3
- no onAny
